### 2x DIY Buttons

Each student presents their two DIY Button prototypes for class and instructor feedback, CTA gives examples of revisions to consider and activities for which they can be used.

---

### Re-designing / Diffusing LEDs

A demonstration of a few ways to embed / diffuse LEDs to productively change their appearance

---

### User Testing + 10 possible revisions

0. Switch prototypes with your partner
1. Following your tests, quickly generate a written list of ten possible revisions to your partner's buttons (don't think too hard about each idea yet, generate a bunch of them first without regard to whether they are "good" ideas or not).
2. Next, revise your list so that only the five best revisions remain.
3. Switch lists, you will be required to implement one of the two revisions identified by your partner in the previous steps

---

### Prototype Journal Format

- Title
- Inspiration / Background
- Invitation
- Summary of the Experience
- Input / Output 1
- Input / Output 2
- Learning Outcome

---

### Title

Giving your prototype a title helps you prioritize focusing on certain features over others. This may change throughout the completion of the prototype.

---

### Inspiration / Background

Inspiration / Background: where did your idea come from? What lead you to this particular idea? What about this is interesting to you (specifically) and why?

---

### Invitation

Come up with a one sentence question or statement you can use to get a participant's attention and try out your prototype. For exmaple: in Leimert Park we ask any person who walks by and makes eye contact with us "do you want to make a robot?"

---

### Summary of the Experience

What do people do when they use your prototype? Describe it step by step.

---

### Input / Output 1

How does a person interact with the first input / output pair? What unique design features contribute to that interaction? What does this iteraction mean in the context of your prototype?

---

### Input / Output 2

How does a person interact with the second input / output pair? What unique design features contribute to that interaction? What does this iteraction mean in the context of your prototype?

---

### Learning Outcome

What does your participant learn by using your prototype? An idea? A new perspective? A concept?
