### 2x Input / 2x Output In-progress Prototype Review

Each student presents their in-progress 2x Input / 2x Output prototypes, and prototype journal, for class and instructor feedback.

---

### User Testing + 10 possible revisions

0. Switch prototypes with your partner
1. Following your tests, quickly generate a written list of ten possible revisions to your partner's prototype (don't think too hard about each idea yet, generate a bunch of them first without regard to whether they are "good" ideas or not).
2. Next, revise your list so that only the five best revisions remain.
3. Return the list you generated for your partner's prototypes, you will be required to implement one of the two revisions identified by your partner in the previous steps

### Simple Enclosures

A demonstration of a few ways to design simple enclosures to enhance the finish of your prototype

## Assignments
- Be prepared to present your final 2x Input / 2x Output Prototype, and Prototype Journal, to class next week!
