## Course Description

The course will explore strategies for leveraging technology to produce a fun, memorable, and educational activity for the 
general public. Students will design and create an interactive prototype, as well as a short activity that requires use of their 
prototype, to teach community members about a technology concept of their selection. Additionally, students will learn, and
experiment with, introductory electronics principles and apply these principles to the creation of a working prototype.
