## Course Description

The course will explore strategies for leveraging technology to produce a fun, memorable, and educational activity for the general public. Students will design and create an interactive prototype, as well as a short activity that requires use of their prototype, to teach community members about a technology concept of their selection. Additionally, students will learn, and experiment with, introductory electronics principles and apply these principles to the creation of a working prototype.

## Machine Project

![bg left](imgs\MachineProject\aboutMachineProject-MAllen.jpg)

Machine Project was a storefront community space founded by [Mark Allen](https://www.markallen.com/) and active in Los Angeles  from 2003-2018. I used to live around the corner from the space and taught there extensively.

### About Machine Project

"Machine Project is an informal, non-profit, educational institution located in a storefront space in the Echo Park neighborhood of Los Angeles and a group of people working together to create, study and share new forms of culture and ways of living. We collaborate with artists, thinkers and local communities to produce non-commercial projects that investigate art, performance, technology, science, music, literature and new ideas for creative engagement. We believe an organization can be a machine for thinking together."

### Electric Melon / Cactus

![bg left](imgs\MachineProject\Melon-Confuse-a-tron-Machine-MCaudill.jpg)

My earliest workshops for Machine Project focused on teaching folks to build [Piezoelectric](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Piezoelectricity) microphones (i.e. "contact microphones").

Contact microphones amplify vibrations in an object or on a surface.

---

### Electric Melon / Cactus

The material properties of the object, as well as its size/surface area, dictate the resulting (frequently percussive) sounds. Large, hollow objects (a metal container) sound different than thin, brittle objects (a piece of paper) through a contact microphone.

The first workshop was an *Amplified Party* (with [John P. Hastings](https://www.johnphastings.org/)). We taught participants to build the mics and then attached those mics to objects they would use during the party: cups containing drinks, bowls containing snacks, and chairs / tables became percussion instruments participants played by behaving normally at a party.
